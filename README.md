 ✋ Hand Gesture Recognition using SVM

This project is developed as part of the *Infotech Skilleraft Technology Internship – Task-04 (July 2025)*.  
The objective of this task is to develop a machine learning model that can recognize and classify different hand gestures using image data.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

To build a *gesture-based control system* that supports *intuitive human-computer interaction* by recognizing hand gestures captured in images.

---

## 📁 Dataset

- *Source*: [Kaggle - LeapGestRecog](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gti-upm/leapgestrecog)
- Contains grayscale gesture images across 10 classes (01 to 10) for 10 different users (00 to 09)
- Over 20,000 images in total
- Preprocessed using OpenCV and resized to 64x64 for SVM input

---

## 🧠 Techniques Used

- *Image Preprocessing* (resizing, grayscale, flattening)
- *SVM Classifier* from scikit-learn
- *Train/Test Split* using train_test_split
- *Model Evaluation* using accuracy score and classification report

---

## 🧰 Libraries Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

---

## 📊 Output Example

- Model classifies gestures such as:  
  01 = Palm, 02 = Fist, 03 = Thumbs Up, etc.
- Achieved good accuracy on test data
- Sample visualizations of predictions are also generated using Matplotlib
